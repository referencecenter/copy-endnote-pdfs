"""
Background:
In the desktop application, EndNote libraries include multiple files:
    The main library file has an .enl extension, but it is connected
    to a .Data folder, which includes other files. The desktop
    application is able to automatically retrieve the full texts of some
    references. Users can upload additional full-text files they have
    access to. Full texts can include PDF files, which are saved in
    separate folders within the .Data folder. Without something like
    this program, users need to manually go into each .Data subfolder
    and copy the PDFs.

Description:
This program copies all PDFs from an EndNote library's .Data subfolders
    to one single folder.

Sample Use Cases:
(1) A researcher wants to share PDFs with collaborators who do not have
    access to the EndNote library.
(2) A patron wants full-text access to the articles a librarian included
    in a literature search.

Instructions:
The only lines users will need to edit are between the long lines of
    hashes (lines 39-58). Specifically, they will need to edit the
    variables in lines 47, 52, and 57 to reflect their specific EndNote
    library and the appropriate filepaths. Note the caution in lines 41â€“
    42 regarding hard drives vs. network drives."""
